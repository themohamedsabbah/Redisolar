# Redisolar
Redisolar is an application built to ingest, process, and display real-time energy data from solar installations.
We install solar panels on the rooftops of homes and businesses, and each installation is referred to as a site.

Every site is equipped with a power meter that reports minute-by-minute measurements of the energy consumed and generated by its solar panels.
This project provides the backend and visualization components required to collect that data and present it in a meaningful, real-time view.
