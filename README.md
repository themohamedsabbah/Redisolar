# Redisolar
Redisolar is an application built to ingest, process, and display real-time energy data from solar installations.
We install solar panels on the rooftops of homes and businesses, and each installation is referred to as a site.

Every site is equipped with a power meter that reports minute-by-minute measurements of the energy consumed and generated by its solar panels.
This project provides the backend and visualization components required to collect that data and present it in a meaningful, real-time view.

# Meter Reading

Each site is equipped with a connected power meter that reports energy metrics once every minute.
For every one-minute interval, the meter sends a meter reading containing the following data:
1. Watt-hours used
2. Watt-hours generated
3. Current temperature (°C)

Every meter reading also includes the site ID and a timestamp, allowing the system to accurately track and analyze energy usage and production over time.
